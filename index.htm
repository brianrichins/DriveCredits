          <li id="episode">Act IV</li>
          <li id="title">RISE OF THE VINN</li>
          <li>
            THE EMPIRE: Having pulled its forward fleets back to defend the core
            system around Tierra, it is building ships as fast as it can. The
            Emperor, La Familia, IndústriaGlobo, and the Jinyiwei have all
            maintained the bulk of their power, in part by letting some distant
            power centers go "unmanaged" during this time of trial.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE CONTINUUM: The Makers are still in the midst of their own
            trials. The first "trial" seeks to judge their greatest living
            Maker, Ahmis, for having birthed a Spirit that is itself a Maker.
            All the while, a new power is appearing on the outer fringes of
            Continuum space, as minor science colonies fall to advancing
            vanguards of Vinn.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE VINN: The Vinn themselves are on the move, conquering larger and
            larger areas of space. And we’re only just beginning to learn what
            drives them.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE GRASSKANS: Having lost the entirety of their 3,500-year old
            empire to the Vinn, the remnant Grasskans are continuing to settle
            on Saseet. With more and more refugees arriving each day, the
            shipyards are being set up to build the fleet the Emperor demanded —
            with the promise that the planet becomes theirs at the war’s end.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE FIVE MOONS OF SLAUGHTER: The Five Crime Families of Slaughter
            are now… mainly dead. Or mainly Vinn. :)
          </li>
          <li>
            THE PRAHSITT: Just on the border of the Grasskan Empire, we actually
            don’t know the current fate of Kik’s homeworld, Wirum.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE REBELLION: With the Empire’s fleets pulled back, and new
            ringship plans distributed by the Tres Primos, the rebels of Las
            Hermanitas are primed to start building their own ships.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE FILLIPODS: Like the human rebels, the Fillipods have also come
            into working plans for a ring drive, and have built their first
            working FTL ship. But it has not kept them from holding the annual
            "Take-a-Chance, Do-That-Dance" Dance-Off that's held in the capital.
            (First prize: Bespoke caps.)
          </li>
          <li>
            THE NYX: The inscrutable, highly creative Nyx have themselves just
            been shown the plans for a ring drive, courtesy of their Fillipod
            guests. Nyx seeing those plans promises an entirely different answer
            to the old question, “What’s new on Du Fu?”
          </li>
          <li>
            THE TESSKANS: The Tesskans are now just a remnant species on Tesskil
            and on various planets across the Empire. But one group of Tesskans
            is a notable exception, having commandeered the largest ship ever
            built: the SPARK OF THOUGHT.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE SILL: The last of a once unimaginably vast Empire, the remnant
            Monks of Yanta are dying, dying, dying. The only Type-2 Kardashev
            civilization that the Milky Way ever produced... now wordlessly
            fading away in the ecstasy of The Quiet.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE VEETANS: With the human fleet away, the Veetans will... bake, most
            likely.
          </li>
          <li>
            THE QEN: Now in the third year of their rebellion against the
            Empire, the Qen will start taking greater and greater advantage of
            the amazing tech found in their rediscovered Slipstream ship.
            Especially with the help of the Tres Primos, who have recently
            arrived on Paa’q....
